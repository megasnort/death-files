#Death files
For feeling at home everywhere.
Probably not of use to anyone except for me, syncing my many computers.

##Usage

1. Clone this repository into a folder somewhere on your computer, f.e. `~/death-files`
2. Run the script `./install.sh`

    - This will add a line to your current .bash_profile that sources all the files in `~/death-files/bash_profile`
    - Will copy all the other .-files in the root of `~/death-files` to `~/`

Should you run the script again, existing files will be overwritten and the line sourcing your files will be added to.
